# Wiz Project — Development Environment
# =============================================================================
# Groups the dev workloads scanned by the AWS connector into a dedicated Wiz
# project. Membership is rule-based: a resource joins this project when it
# lives in the target AWS account AND carries the environment=ra-workshop-dev
# tag that the infra/aws stack stamps on every dev resource (via default_tags).
